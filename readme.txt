Sorts wp_list_pages-generated page lists by last name or, more generally, the last word of any page's title.

== Description ==

Aimed at archivists and other WordPress developers who use the names of individuals as page titles, this plugin sorts `wp_list_pages`-generated page lists by last name. More generally, the plugin can also be used to sort `wp_list_pages`-generated page lists by the last word of any page's title.

== Installation ==

After installing and activating, developers can order any `wp_list_pages`-generated page list by surname -- or, more generally, last word -- using the `sortbylastname=1` parameter, e.g., `<?php wp_list_pages('title_li=&sortbylastname=1'); ?>`. Use a "0" to (temporarily) disable the plugin.

= Developer Notes =

PLEASE NOTE: Line 14 extracts each separate line of HTML from the original `wp_list_pages` output and puts it into an array called `$lines.` The `\n` parameter tells the explode command that each line ends with a carriage return. However, as of WordPress 3.2.1, the explode command assumes each line ends when it finds an `n`. As such, if developers edit the plugin using the WordPress code editor, they should add an extra backslash (`\`) in front of the `n` before saving the file (e.g, `$lines = explode("\\n", $val);`). The line will revert to `$lines = explode("\n", $val);` on save.
